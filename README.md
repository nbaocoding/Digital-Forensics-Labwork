# 🧮 Digital Forensics Lab Work

This repository contains a collection of hands-on digital forensics labs focused on Linux, Windows, mobile, and network environments. The labs emphasize practical techniques used in real-world investigations such as timeline reconstruction, artifact recovery, user activity correlation, and memory analysis.

   Identifies and analyzes hidden data embedded in multimedia files.

3. **Recovering Deleted and Damaged Files**  
   Demonstrates data recovery through file carving and hex-level analysis.

4. **Conducting an Incident Response Investigation**  
   Documents key steps in live response and post-breach evidence collection.

5. **Forensic Investigations on Windows Systems**  
   Investigates Windows-specific artifacts like registry keys, logs, and application usage traces.

6. **Forensic Investigations on Linux Systems**  
   Analyzes bash history, system logs, cron jobs, and shell artifact correlation.

7. **Email and Chat Log Analysis**  
   Examines metadata, headers, and message content for signs of tampering or exfiltration.
